    <h1>24 Hours Away Reflection</h1>
    <p>In fall of 2024, I deleted all social media off my phone. Using my phone had increasingly begun to make me feel
        sick, switching between apps like an animal pacing in a cage. I wasted hours in bed after class, exhausted, and
        when I broke from this trance I did not feel rested, I felt shame. Social media was an anesthetizing stream of
        bright lights that made emotions temporarily bearable. Over the next few weeks, I found myself compulsively
        reaching to check my phone, anxiously grabbing for it in moments of silence before consciously realizing I had
        nothing to look at.
        Fully unplugging felt like more of a challenge. While I have mostly unplugged on my mobile device (save for apps
        like are.na and substack which I feel encourage more critical usage), I am incredibly reliant on my laptop for
        my job, schoolwork, and extracurriculars. I messaged my friends and family to let them know I would be
        unavailable to contact for a day, and made sure to make myself a schedule. I went and met a friend
        for coffee in the morning, took a walk, engaged in offline hobbies, and read.
        One of the most immediate things I noticed was the silence. I find it uncomfortable to sit in silence, I am
        always listening to music or podcasts. The silence forced me to contend with my immediate environment and
        thoughts. I thought about my relationship with technology, a relationship I often feel forced into. Reading the
        New York Times article, I reflected on the class element mentioned. The Luddite Movement was a labor movement,
        and while making the effort to unplug individually can be healthy, it's important to ground our discussions in
        the context of labor and collective action. Capital encourages technologies that demand efficiency at the cost
        of quality, bleeding into our work and personal lives. This degradation requires a collective response.
